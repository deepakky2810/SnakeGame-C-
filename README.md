# SnakeGame-C-
# A snake game built purely using C++ and uses Win32API to run.
**I invite you all guys to take a look on this basic game that I have tried to develop. This is my software project.**
This game still has quite a few bugs, some of which I have figured out, and I am sure there a re several others which are unnoticed till now.
I have not documented the source code, but will soon do this, as it will be helpful to the one who want to use this file and tinker with it.
Thats it for now!
